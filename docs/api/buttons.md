# Buttons

Buttons are also classes in Formulaic. They don't actually do anything special;
they're supplied as a convenience.

## `Button`
Generic button (`type="button"`).

### `Button::__construct(string $text = null, string $name = null)`
A button with the defined `$text` in it, and `name="$name"`.

## `Button\Submit`
Submit button.

## `Button\Reset`
Reset button. The resetting is purely something client side.
